## Blahaj is a simple to use name chooser site for blahaj plushes.

### Q and A
---
- Why?

`I keep on seeing "What should be his name?" posts on the r/blahaj subreddit, so i made this to choose for them.`

- How?

`The site does a CORS request for a file named "names.txt", then chooses a random one.`

---

### How do I add/suggest names?

Go to [issues](https://github.com/WalkTheEarth/Blahaj/issues), then click "New Report" (or similar) then look for "Name Request", press the green button next to it, and fill out the form.

### How do I report bugs?

Same as above, but instead of "Name Request" do "Bug Report" 

### How do I host?

1. Clone the repo.
2. run `cd Blahaj`
3. then run whatever http server command you use. (Like `python3 -m http.server`)
4. (if using the command i supplied you with) Go to "localhost:8000`

### How do I tip?

No need. I made this in my free time.
